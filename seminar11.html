					<section>
						<h3>Formalities </h3>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Length: 13-15 pages (excluding references and title page) </li>
							<li class="fragment">Should make critical and selective use of at least 10 scientific sources beyond those covered in class. </li>
							<li class="fragment">Deadline: Upload to Moodle by 15th Sep</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>From syllabus </h3>
						<p>(It is also always a good idea to read the guidelines in the syllabus!)</p>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Independent formulation of concise and scientifically workable research question. </li>
							<li class="fragment">Selection of relevant theoretical framework(s) to answer RQ.</li>
							<li class="fragment">An independent literature review centered on RQ. </li>
							<li class="fragment">Analysis of RQ (many options here: empirical/theoretical, quantitative/qualitative, etc., but keep it simple) </li>
							<li class="fragment">The paper "must be analytical, not merely descriptive". </li>
							
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Expectations and evaluation criteria </h3>
						<ol>
							<li class="fragment">Relevant selection and accurate understanding of theory and literature. </li>
							<li class="fragment">Clear argumentation (define concepts, and justify claims). </li>
							<li class="fragment">Application of theory - using concepts from class to explain something (a case/phenomona/etc of your choice).</li>
							<li class="fragment">Originality and critical thinking/reflection. </li>
						</ol>
						<p class="fragment">These evaluation criteria are ordered, meaning you need to satisfy the first criteria before you can address the later. </p>
					</section>

						<h3>Analysis and methods </h3>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">No (or very few) expectaions in terms of format and methods used. </li>
							<li class="fragment">You are encouraged to use your strengths from previous degrees and courses. </li>
							<li class="fragment">Inspiration for methods: 
								<ul>
									<li class="fragment">Methods section in Elstub, S., and O. Escobar. 2019. Handbook of Democratic Innovation and Governance. Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, UNITED KINGDOM: Edward Elgar Publishing Limited. (available as ebook through TUM library)</li>

					<section>
						<h3 class="fragment">Specific databases: </h3>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment"><a href="https://participedia.net/">Participedia</a>: A (long-running) project to crowdsource a database of democratic innovations. A great source to find cases for comparative papers or case studies. The whole crowdsourced dataset about all cases and methods on the website can also be downloaded for quantitative analysis. </li>
							<li class="fragment"><a href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/">Harvard Dataverse</a>: A huge repository of research relevant data (mostly quantitative and datasets for replication of papers, but not exclusively). Search for democratic innovations or specific things of interest (such as "mini-public" fx.) to find existing relevant datasets. </li>
							<li class="fragment"><a href="http://politicize.eu/">POLITICIZE</a>: Research project that aims to collect a comprehensive inventory of mini-publics from across Europe. Possible to browse data on website to search for suitable cases, and download whole dataset for quantitative analysis. </li>
							<li class="fragment"><a href="http://participatedb.com">ParticipateDB</a>: A database of digital participatory innovations from around the world. </li>
							<li class="fragment"><a href="https://www.latinno.net/en/">LATINNO</a>: A (very comprehensive) repository of democratic innovations with a focus on latin America </li>
							<li class="fragment"><a href="https://www.mehr-demokratie.de/datenbank-buergerbegehren">Mehr Demokratie's database of Bürgerbegehren</a>: List of all citizens initiatives that has taken place at the local level in Germany, maintained by the NGO Mehr Demokratie. </li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Find case studies by looking at some of the (countless) consultancies and NGO's that offer to organise "citizen engagement" or "public consultations". They often list projects they worked on, on their websites. </p>
						<p class="fragment">To find such organisations, look for instance at <a href="https://democracyrd.org/">Democracy R&D's website</a>. This is a global network of mini-public organisers. </p>
						<p class="fragment">Finally, feel free to email me for advise on where to find specific data for your paper ideas!</p>

					<section>
						<p class="fragment">Graham Smith's definition: </p>
						<h2 class="fragment">"Institutions that have been specifically designed to increase and deepen citizen participation in the political decision-making process."</h2>
						<ol>
							<li class="fragment">Directly engage citizens (so excluding organised interest groups) </li>
							<li class="fragment">Institutionalised participation </li>
							<ul>
								<li class="fragment">Beyond the (hyper) local level. </li>
								<li class="fragment">Beyond "traditional" institutionalised engagement, ie. elections and consultations. </li>
								<li class="fragment">Excluding informal participation (protests etc.) </li>
							</ul>
						</ol>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p class="fragment">10 years (and a lot of research) later, a new definition suggested by Elstub and Escobar: </p>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">"Processes or institutions...</li>
							<li class="fragment">...that are new to a policy issue, policy role, or level of governance, </li>
							<li class="fragment">...and developed to reimagine and deepen the role of citizens in governance processes</li>
							<li class="fragment">...by increasing opportunities for participation, deliberation and influence." </li>
						</ul>
						<p class="fragment">Questions for discussion: </p>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">How does this definition differ from Graham Smith's? </li>
							<li class="fragment">Do you think this definition is an improvement? Why? Why not? </li>
							<li class="fragment">Is it too broad? Does it include too many things to still be meaningful? (concept stretching) </li>
							<li class="fragment">What do they have in common? </li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Discussion</h3>
						<p class="fragment">So regardless of the definition we use, democratic innovations are about institutions that allow direct citizen involvement. </p>
						<p class="fragment">With this in mind, do you think... </p>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Democratic innovations could/should (have) be(en) used to determine societal responses to a pandemic?</li>
							<li class="fragment">What could potential advantages be in involving citizens directly in this?</li>

						<h2>Ian O'Flynn's critiques of Smith's democratic goods: </h2>
						<p class="fragment">(As well as a general critique of ecumenical approaches)</p>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Democratic goods so broad that they need further interpretation to be useful. </li>
							<li class="fragment">Different goods can be at odds with each other, so we need normative framework to prioritise between them. </li>
							<li class="fragment">The very definition of democratic innovations is democratically normative, as well as each of Smith's "goods" (even if they are presented as general goods). </li>
						</ul>
						<p class="fragment">=> We need a theory of democracy to clearly specify our normative expectations of democratic innovations. </p>

					<section>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Minimal/Schumpeterian Democracy </li>
							<ul class="fragment">
								<li style="font-style: italic">Main mechanism: Competetive elections for leaders. </li>
								<li style="font-style: italic">Reasoning: Ordinary people are not good decision makers, but elections provide an incentive for rulers to not become tyrannical. </li>
								<li style="font-style: italic">Main propnents: Schumpeter (1942) </li>
							</ul>
							<li class="fragment">Deliberative Democracy </li>
							<ul class="fragment">
								<li style="font-style: italic">Main mechanism: The force of the better argument should determine political outcomes (rather than the majority) </li>
								<li style="font-style: italic">Reasoning: Under the right circumstances and conditions, all people are able to participate in reasoned debate, and agree on what is best for the common good. </li>
								<li style="font-style: italic">Some proponents: Jürgen Habermas, James Fishkin, John Dryzek, and many more. </li>

							<ul class="fragment">
								<li style="font-style: italic">Main mechanism: Direct citizen participation in decision-making at all levels. </li>

						<h3>Discussion: </h3>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">How easy or challenging do you think it is to apply Smith's democratic goods to real cases of democratic innovations? </li>
							<li class="fragment">Which are the challenges of using this as an analytical framework? </li>
							<li class="fragment">Do you think it changes your view on using democratic innovations to respond to a crisis like a pandemic, whether you see the problem from the point of a specific democratic theory? Or if you use an ecumenical approach like Graham Smith's? </li>

					<section>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">A large plurality of approaches to conceptualise democracy, both normative and descriptive...</li>
							<li class="fragment">...but they are all too narrowly according to Saward. </li>

						<p class="fragment">"...if we step back from existing approaches and models to interrogate how the present models are built, and how new and hybrid ones might be build, we can create a new framework for thinking about democracy." (p.xii)</p>

					<section>
						<p class="fragment">Three key factors of democracy: </p>
						<ol>
							<li class="fragment">Democracy is not a one-size-fits-all and nor should it be (p. xii)</li>

							<li class="fragment">Democracy may not only apply to the usual units; in particular the nation state. But also to cross-national regions, and more local units simultaneously. </li>

						<p class="fragment">=> Need to move beyond the distinction between theoretical (normative) and empirical (descriptive) approaches to democracy, and develop a practical appraoch that can support the... </p>

						<h2>First and second order analysis, and the practice of designing democracy </h2>

						<p class="fragment">“Design—the intentional creation of plans to solve a problem – is the key to understanding today’s and creating tomorrow’s democratic governance.” (p. xiv)</p>
						<h3 class="fragment">A second-order framework for democracy poses both opportunities and challenges: </h3>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Opportunities: Flexibility of democratic ideas and practices encourages novel thinking and experimenting. </li>
							<li class="fragment">Challenges: Not all ideas and practices are necesarrily (more) democratic => some limitations needed to avoid concept-stretching. </li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					
					
					<section>
						<h2>The Democratic Design Framework </h2>						
						<p class=fragment">...provides designers of democracy with: </p>
						<ol class="fragment">
							<li>Critical (minimum) standards for democracy </li>
							<li>How to combine design options </li>
							<li>How to balance different principles in democratic designs </li>
						</ol>

							<li class="fragment">'practices' </li>
							<p class="fragment"><em>...enacts...</em></p>
							<li class="fragment">'principles' </li>
						</ul>
						<p class="fragment"><em>Systemic design</em> (the combination of democratic practices) and <em>reflexive design</em> (the context of democracy) </p>
						
					</section>
					
					
					<section>
						<h2>Question for discussion:</h2> 
						<ul>
							<li>Who is the designer of democracy? (which actors can you think of that <em>designs</em> democracy? </li>
							<li>Does it make sense to think of democracy as something that is intentionally designed to work in a certain way and meet certain goals? </li>
							<li>If we want to use democratic innovations in the face of a pandemic, who should design and implement these? </li>
							<li>Do you think the current pandemic could affect the opportunities for citizen involvement in our democracies? </li>
							<li>Is democracy – and should it be – a fixed concept?</li>
							<li>And what is the advantage/challenges of “allowing” many different conceptualisations of democracy? </li>
							<li>Does the concept of democracy lose it’s meaning if we do not have a shared understanding of what it mean? </li>
							<li>Do you see ways in which the current pandemic changes our democracies and opportunities to implement democratic innovations? </li>
							<li>Do you think democratic innovations could contribute to addressing the current pandemic? </li>
