						<h2>What are they? </h2>
						<p>Clodagh Harris' definition: </p>
						<p class="fragment">"...a democratic innovation<span class="fragment">, in which a sub-group of citizens (some of whome may be randomly or quasi-randomly selected)</span><span class="fragment"> engage with experts, witnesses, advocates, stakeholders and one another</span><span class="fragment">, in facilitated informed deliberations on a given matter</span><span class="fragment">, and publicly present their opinions and/or recommendations to their commissioning body and wider society."</span> (p. 47) </p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Many different types of Mini-publics</h2>
						<img src="pic/week4/MP-table.svg" />
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>But the all share a general process involving: </h3>
						<ol>
							<li class="fragment">An information phase. </li>
							<li class="fragment">A deliberation phase. </li>
							<li class="fragment">And some result based on this, in the form of a decision, recommendations, or reporting of insights. </li>
						</ol>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Which democratic theory would you say mini-publics fits best with?</h3>

				</section>
				
				
				<section>
					<h3 style="color: rgb(0,101,189)">Discussion and reflection </h3>
					<section>
						<h2>Two questions</h2>
						<ol>
							<li class="fragment">If you were invited to participate in a mini-public would you say yes? Why?</li>
							<li class="fragment">Would you trust a mini-publiic to represent you/make decisions on your behalf? </li>
							<ul>
								<li class="fragment">(or would you trust a mini-public more or less than elected representatives?)</li>
							</ul>
						</ol>
						<p class=fragment">That probably depends on a lot of factors. </p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Considering different cases, what would it take for you to want to participate in a MP or trust the outcomes of a MP you did not participate in? </p>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Who - or what - should be represented in the MP? (ie. how should participants be recruited) </li>
							<li class="fragment">Which expertise should be presented to the participants? (witness testimonies, academic experts, interest groups) </li>
							<li class="fragment">How many times and how often should MP meet? </li>
							<li class="fragment">How big should the MP be?</li>
							<li class="fragment">Should participants be compensated for their time? </li>
							<li class="fragment">Is the process of deliberation important? (group discussions vs. plenum, majority decision vs. consensus, super majority, or meta consensus)</li>
							<li class="fragment">What should the facilitator(s)' most important role be?</li>
						</ul>
