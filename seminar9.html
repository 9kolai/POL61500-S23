					<section>
						<p>As we have seen by now, democratic innovations refer to specific institutions, that are meant to enhance democracy. </p>
						<h3 class="fragment">But where do specific democratic innovations fit in democracy at large? </h3>
						<ol>
							<li class="fragment">How do we best combine democratic innovations with each other?  </li>
							<li class="fragment">And with traditional democratic instiutions (assuming that we do not want to replace tradtional democratic institutions completely)?  </li>

					<section>
						<p>Mansbridge, J., Bohman, J., Chambers, S., Christiano, T., Fung, A., Parkinson, J., Thompson, D.F., Warren, M.E., 2012. A systemic approach to deliberative democracy, in: Parkinson, J., Mansbridge, J. (Eds.), Deliberative Systems: Deliberative Democracy at the Large Scale. pp. 1–26.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p class="fragment"> "Yet no single forum, however ideally constituted, could possess deliberative capacity sufficient to legitimate most of the decisions and policies that democracies adopt. To understand the larger goal of deliberation, we suggest that it is necessary to go beyond the study of individual institutions and processes to examine their interaction in the system as a whole." (p.1-2)</p>
						<h3 class="fragment">Definition of deliberative system: </h3>
						<p class="fragment">"A deliberative system is one that encompasses a talk-based approach to political conflict and problem-solving  – through arguing, demonstrating, expressing, and persuading. In a good deliberative system, persuasion that raises relevant considerations should replace suppression, oppression, and thoughtless neglect. Normatively, a systemic approach means that the system should be judged as a whole in addition to the parts being judged independently." (p. 5)</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Three (main) functions that can promote deliberative system: </h3>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment"><strong>Epistemic function:</strong> <span class="fragment">Formation of wills, opinions, and decisions based on facts, logic, relevant reasons and informed by taking into consideration the preferences and opinions of fellow citizens. Or in short seeking truth. </span></li>
							<li class="fragment"><strong>Ethical function:</strong> <span class="fragment">Building mutual respect among citizens. Mutual respect is not only a precondition for deliberation (it is not possible to take other people's opinions into account without respecting them as authors of opinions and justifications), but it is also an ethical good in itself. </span></li>
							<li class="fragment"><strong>Democratic function:</strong> <span class="fragment">Promoting an inclusive political process on terms of equality. "The inclusion of multiple and plural voices, interests, concerns, and claims on the basis of feasible equality..." (p. 12)</span></li>
						</ul>

						<h3>Defects in the deliberative system </h3>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment"><strong>Tight-coupling:</strong> Nodes are coupled too closely together so they will just echo each other instead of complementing each other. </li>
							<li class="fragment"><strong>Decoupling:</strong> Nodes are not connected at all, so good arguments arising in one part does not reach other parts of the system. </li>
							<li class="fragment"><strong>Institutional domination:</strong> When one part of the system - whether deliberative or not - dominates all the others. Or exert undue influence on the others.</li>
							<li class="fragment"><strong>Social Domination:</strong> When one social interest or social class (such as the most wealthy) dominates or exert undue influence on the rest of the system. </li>
							<li class="fragment"><strong>Entrenched partisanship:</strong> While it can be useful to discuss matters in partisan parts of the deliberative system, each of these parts need to still be open to listen to the other parts for this to have any deliberative value.</li>
						</ul>

						<h3>Discussion: The case of social media </h3>
						<p class="fragment">Social media as an example of a space with "communicative plenty", ie. an overload of possibilities to express opinions. </p>

					<section>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">A large plurality of approaches to conceptualise democracy, both normative and descriptive...</li>
							<li class="fragment">...but they are all too narrowly according to Saward. </li>
						</ul>
						<p class="fragment">"...if we step back from existing approaches and models to interrogate how the present models are built, and how new and hybrid ones might be build, we can create a new framework for thinking about democracy." (p.xii)</p>

						<p class="fragment">Three key factors of democracy: </p>
						<ol>
							<li class="fragment">Democracy is not a one-size-fits-all and nor should it be (p. xii)</li>
							<li class="fragment">Democracy is unfinished business. </li>
							<li class="fragment">Democracy may not only apply to the usual units; in particular the nation state. But also to cross-national regions, and more local units simultaneously. </li>

						<h2>Discussion</h2>
						<ul class="fragment">
							<li>Is democracy – and should it be – a fixed concept?</li>
							<li>And what is the advantage/challenges of “allowing” many different conceptualisations of democracy? </li>
							<li>Does the concept of democracy lose it’s meaning if we do not have a shared understanding of what it mean? </li>

						<h2>First and second order analysis, and the practice of designing democracy </h2>

						<p class="fragment">“Design—the intentional creation of plans to solve a problem – is the key to understanding today’s and creating tomorrow’s democratic governance.” (p. xiv)</p>
						<h3 class="fragment">A second-order framework for democracy poses both opportunities and challenges: </h3>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Opportunities: Flexibility of democratic ideas and practices encourages novel thinking and experimenting. </li>
							<li class="fragment">Challenges: Not all ideas and practices are necesarrily (more) democratic => some limitations needed to avoid concept-stretching. </li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					
					
					<section>
						<h2>The Democratic Design Framework </h2>						
						<p class=fragment">...provides designers of democracy with: </p>
						<ol class="fragment">
							<li>Critical (minimum) standards for democracy </li>
							<li>How to combine design options </li>
							<li>How to balance different principles in democratic designs </li>
						</ol>
						
						<p class="fragment">Two central elements form the "dual core" of the democratic design framework: </p>

							<li class="fragment">Who is the designer of democracy? (which actors can you think of that <em>designs</em> democracy? </li>
